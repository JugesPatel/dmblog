Unlike most traditional board games you're familiar with Monopoly, Clue or The Game of Life, the rules for D&D are not an instruction guide on how to play the game step-by-step. The rules are in place for both the Dungeon Master (DM) and the adventurers to figure out how to advance the story. The DM uses the rules as reference when a scene or particular encounter comes into play. Knowledge of the rules, like any other game, comes over time as you actually play the game so don't sweat it if you don't know that the rules for hiding are in Chapter 7 under the subheading Dexterity. Over time, you'll learn to flip through the rule book when a situation arises you don't know how to handle and crease the pages of the book enough to flip to the exact spot.

## Game Rules

Now the biggest question of your DM-ing career is figuring out if you are old-school and like having notes written down in front of you or whether you prefer the convenience of technology. Either way Wizards of the Coast, the publishers of D&D, have made the basic rules available free for everyone to use, both digitally and in a pdf for you to print.

If you want all the rules offline, at your fingertips, this is the best place to get them: [Basic rules in a PDF](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)

If you prefer an interactive online tool-set, use this site: [Basic rules on DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules)

## Key areas to cover

> Now you may be asking, do I really need to read this entire 180 page document to play? And the answer is a resounding *no*... But read just enough to get started.

There are a few key places in the rules you should read over to get an idea of how the game works. Reading the following sections should give you a better understanding of the game:

- Introduction
  > The best intro I could never write, this is the perfect place for cementing the idea of D&D into your head
- Ch 7: Using Ability Scores
  > The bread and butter of resolving most player actions
- Ch 8: Adventuring
  > Bringing the dungeons into Dungeons and Dragons
- Ch 9: Combat
  > Bringing the dragons into Dungeons and Dragons
- Ch. 10: Spellcasting
  > How the rules of magic generally work in this game
- Ch. 12: Monsters
  > For when you need to bring the players back in line

Here are some places where you should give a brief glance to know what they contain but it might be better to reference them as you're playing:

- Ch. 1: Step-by-Step Characters
  > Gives you an idea of how adventurers are made
- Ch. 2: Races
  > More for inspiration for the different types of inhabitants of this world
- Ch. 3: Classes
  > For an idea of what the adventurers can actually do
- Ch. 5: Equipment
  > For when the players eventually decide to spend an hour browsing a merchant's stall
- Ch. 11: Spells
  > Gives you an idea of all the ways the adventurers can mess with your world and it's inhabitants
- Ch. 14: Magic Items
  > Shiny new things to keep the players hooked

Now for your players at the table, they have some homework too. They should at least read all of **Ch. 1: Step-by-Step Characters** to get an idea of what makes up a character. Now in my experience, after you give them this chapter, they can't wait to make their own adventurer. This will naturally lead them into reading **chapters 2 - 6** so I would just keep encouraging it. But also make sure they skim **chapters 7,8,9** so that you will have a little less heavy lifting when it comes time to actually playing the game.

If the players don't decide to create characters after reading through chapter 1, you can still provide them with pre-generated ones found here: [Pre-generated Character Sheets](https://dnd.wizards.com/charactersheets)

## Next step

It's a lot of effort to go through all this material but if you've started, give yourself a pat on the back! This is the beginning of a long and rewarding journey and it builds the foundation for all the fun stuff to come. Once you familiarize yourself with the rule book, you'll naturally start using it as a reference when you run the game and it will become a tool in your belt that you get more comfortable using over time.

Now that you have the foundation built, we can start planning the first adventure for your players to play through and get them hooked enough to come back for more.
