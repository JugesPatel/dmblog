Hats off to you if you've already gone through the recommended chapters in the basic rules, we've almost gotten to the fun stuff. And if you haven't, well you're probably in the same boat I'd be in and need some sort of push to get through it. How about we set a deadline by scheduling your first session?

## Assemble Your Party

Your first big step is to find a group of people that have a spare 3 hours and would be interested in playing. This could be family, friends, coworkers, anyone on the street. Maybe not the last one... but really all you need is some enthusiasm or curiosity from the players and you can just build on that. Be upfront with the time commitment, unlike regular board games, we can't really come to a satisfying ending within 20-40 minutes. I would recommend you give yourself at least 2.5 hours and maybe more if you have a break in between. This is so that both you and the players have time to really explore the game and also to account for the time learning how to play.

I would also recommend keeping this first session to only three to four players, not including yourself. This is just to keep things a little more simple and the more players there are at the table means less time for each player. This makes them more likely to tune out or get distracted. If you find you have too many players interested, that's great! But you can just run the same adventure twice! If you find you only have one or two players interested, it's also totally okay! As we prepare the adventure we can make some small tweaks to balance encounters for a smaller party.

## Picking the Table

Now I will admit, the experience of playing a game in-person can't really be matched but with all the tools out there for playing online, you can come pretty close.

If you decide on playing in person, you really just need to find a spot to play that everyone can sit comfortably with their character sheets and dice. Possibly some extra space for a visual map if you decide on going that route. A kitchen table would work perfectly for this, but you could also squeeze the players on a couch while you setup on a coffee table. Anything where everyone has a view of each other and a clear view of you, the DM should work.

## A Virtual Table

If you decide on playing online, all you really need is a VoIP client like Discord, Skype, FaceTime, etc. where you can talk to the players real-time. Preferably with video but it's not necessary. My recommendation would be to use Discord since it gives you a lot of tools that you can make use of while actually playing the session all for free. There is a great video tutorial on setting up a discord server for D&D by Mike Shea of Sly Flourish: [Playing D&D Online with Discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yg-GyrcccI). But if you don't want to spend the effort making an account/server then just go with whatever you and your group already uses to keep in touch over voice. As long as everyone can hear each other, the game will play out just fine.

## Setting a Date

In this hobby, you'll hear the worst enemy an adventuring party can face is scheduling. You'll soon learn that there is some truth in that but it also doesn't have to be that difficult. If you are planning on running this game for more than just one session, I would recommend picking a time that generally works for the whole group on a consistent basis and just use the first session as a starting point. If you are just trying the game out for a session, just be warned that the experience is a little infectious and you might have players coming back for more.

## Spreading Excitement with Homework

Now if you've managed to figure out the logistics, all you have left is getting the players to buy in. You can decide if you want to give your group pre-generated characters or if you want to have them create their own. Either way I'd recommend they skim through the chapters of the rules needed for players in the last post: [How do I Play](../_posts/2021-09-23-How-do-I-Play.md).

If you choose to give the players characters sheets, hand them out before the session. Tell them to read through the whole sheet at least once, but tell them to ignore the background section. They will be coming up with their own background for their character, something that relates to your setting.

If you choose to let your players create their own characters, encourage them to communicate with each other about what they're coming up with. This is sure to drum up some excitement. But more importantly, make sure they are creating a character that fits into the setting of your adventure.


## The Pitch

All you really need to give the players is one solid adventure pitch. For this series, I'm going to give an example pitch that we'll build on in coming posts but don't feel the need to use this exact one. You can modify it any way you like and even just forgo it completely for your own if you have a better idea. The more important thing to learn is the process of building it.

We want a setting simple enough for the players to grasp, but also one that has an air of mystery. We also want to give the players the direction of the adventure, you could call this the *quest*. It doesn't have to be the detailed write-up, just the problem that the adventurers are trying to solve. And with that, let's try this out:

>In the small mining town of Cloverton, there spreads a great evil... Crawling, shambling closer to the light, something has been unearthed that had been buried away for a very long time. It may have been by natural forces inside the mountain or perhaps excavations by the Lion's Head Mining Company, but whatever it is needs to be dealt with. It started slowly, with a few miners going missing but now the surrounding wildlife has been scared off and the people are starting to question the dwindling supply of able-bodied miners. The Lion's Head Mining Company has put out a contract for helping them solve their little problem and you, brave adventurer, are the one for the job.

Give your players a pitch and sit back as they come up with the craziest backgrounds to fit into your world. Meanwhile, we shall work on actually building out the town of Cloverton and figure out what's actually in that mine.
