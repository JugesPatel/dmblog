        <p>Do you ever get a feeling of triumph seeing two hobbits named Sam and Frodo watch the One Ring dissolve into the fires of Mount Doom? Or when a farmboy named Luke Skywalker fires two proton torpedoes into the thermal exhaust port of planet-destroying Death Star? Or when Superman finally defeats Lex Luthor, Rocky Balboa knocks out Apollo Creed in the final round of their rematch, or when one of the countless protagonists from a novel or movie you enjoy succeeds in their quest?</p>

<p>That feeling is one that can only exist if the characters, the world, and the conflict in those stories are something you believe in. Even for the short amount of time you may be watching them on a screen or bringing them to life from page to imagination. These worlds that exist have to be imagined by somebody, but they only exist in that personâ€™s head until they are shared with others.</p>

<h2 id="dungeons-and-dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</h2>

<p>The whole premise of tabletop roleplaying games and by extension, Dungeons and Dragons, is to tell a collaborative story. A story not like any other you may have experienced in popular culture. This is a story which exists only in the minds of everyone at the table. But everyone playing has a hand in contributing to it. Out of all the players in in D&amp;D, one takes the role of Dungeon Master and the rest take the role of adventurers.</p>

<p>The <strong>adventurers</strong> are the protagonists (<em>or antagonists</em>) of the story. They are the ones to cheer for, the ones that bring change, conflict, and tension into the world you have created. The players are responsible for getting in the minds of their adventurers and acting not as themselves, but the characters they portray.</p>

<h3 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h3>

<p>As a <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> or <strong>DM</strong>, you are basically everything else that makes up the world. You are the gameâ€™s lead storyteller. You are the lens that the players look into to see the world that you have created. The places that they can go, the allies they can make, the enemies they may encounter. Without the world, the players have nothing to explore and nothing to do but without the players, there is no story to tell. Itâ€™s a balancing act, one that takes years to perfect but creates the entire premise of the game.</p>

<h3 id="referee">Referee</h3>

<p>As a DM you are also responsible for enforcing the rules or creating new ones when there are none that fit. Taking what the players say and interpreting the rules of the game into actions which will be resolved by the roll of a dice. This is where the game gets interesting because nothing in the story is certain. The nature of rolling to determine an outcome means that anything can and will happen. However, the adventurers are created in such a way that might make them better suited for certain situations versus others.</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-the-game">Structure of the Game</h3>

<p>The game follows a structure where the DM gives a description of a dark dingy dungeon, perhaps acts as a supporting character giving a quest, or narrates a bar brawl happening before the adventurersâ€™ eyes. The players now choose how they interact with the situation put before them, communicating with the DM what their intentions are. The DM now makes a call how to proceed, whether the actions that the players want to take requires a die roll or just happens. Either way, they narrate the outcome and now the players are left back in the driverâ€™s seat as they interact with more of the world.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-dungeon-master">So Why Dungeon Master?</h2>

<p>While this may sound like a lot of work, the moments you are creating with players at the table rival, even surpass, the ones you can get from novels, movies, and TV shows. As games go on, every D&amp;D player will tell you their investment into the world only grows deeper. And as most DMs will tell you, the attachment and inspiration put into the world that they have created only grows stronger.</p>

<p>D&amp;D is a wonderful hobby and one that more people should have the pleasure of experiencing. The only way to really play is to have someone step up and learn <em>just enough</em> to bring a world to life in front of a group of players. And those players giving into the suspension of disbelief and creating an epic adventure.</p>

<p>So if you are attracted to telling a story:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With twists and turns brought by complete misunderstandings</li>
  <li>Where running jokes become the norm</li>
  <li>Where subtle clues can lead to mind-shattering revelations</li>
  <li>Where you fly by the seat of your pants, improvising at every opportunity</li>
  <li>Where a world from your imagination comes to life</li>
</ul>

<p>You should probably become a Dungeon Master.</p>
