Now as the name Dungeons & Dragons implies, dungeons make up half of game and the other half are dragons. This is not entirely untrue. Exploration is a large part of the game and that means that more often than not, players will go to interesting locations with little information in order to fulfill their goals. Goals may include clearing out dangerous enemies, finding a secret artifact hidden in that place, or simply the call of adventure and fight against boredom. Don't think of dungeons as just dark places underground that have been untouched for centuries, think of them as any interesting location that players will explore. An example of a dungeon that's not actually a dungeon could be a wizarding school that the players need to tour in order to find secret tomes to help them on their quest. Or a noble estate could be considered a "dungeon" where players need to sneak into a royal gala in order to gather information about the dastardly plans of a lord.

My process for creating all these interesting locations is the same:

- We figure out the purpose of the location, what is it used for and if applicable, what **was** it used for
- What sort of barriers are there to getting into the location
- Who or what guards this location
- What treasure exists for the players to find
