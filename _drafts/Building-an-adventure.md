In this blog, we will be taking the setting we created last post ([Creating Your Adventure Setting](../_posts/2021-10-29-Creating-adventure-setting.md)) and use it to prepare an adventure that we can put in front of the players and run.

There is a distinction here of the two different kinds of preparation that we are doing. In the last post we prepared the adventure setting, also called world-building. We created a world that the players will interact with and while some of the things we prepared like locations and NPCs will come up in game, some of this material will not directly affect the players. What we're preparing in this post is everything we will be using during the actual game. We'll keep it contained to one or two sheets of paper that we can reference during play and it should have roughly everything we need for the session.

Let's summarize what we have so far:

- We have a basic grasp on the rules of the game
- We have scheduled a session with some friends and/or family to play out this adventure
- We have a quest that we can give to the players to get them started
- We have an adventure setting with a few key characters, locations, and a little bit of history

All we have left to do is write the adventure! While this may sound like the most daunting of all the tasks, I'll let you in on a little secret... it's the easiest one.

## What do we need to prepare?

One problem I've run into when preparing for a session is trying to account for every situation that the players might encounter during the game. Having a response for everything means I was spending a lot of extra time preparing for things that never actually happened during game. I probably used anywhere from 15% - 60% of the material I had prepped most sessions. Not to say that the things I prepared didn't help, it's more to highlight the amount of time that went into that remaining material could have been spent elsewhere. So I have adopted a minimalist approach to game preparation and always having just enough so that I use my time efficiently.

So here are the areas I would focus on for preparing this adventure:

- The start of the quest - how did the players arrive?
- What's the layout of the mine?
- What dangerous enemies might the players encounter?
- What sort of treasure can the players stumble upon?
- If the players succeed or fail, what are the consequences?

## Mapping out the mine


## Populating the enemies


## Treasure



## Fallout and the conclusion
