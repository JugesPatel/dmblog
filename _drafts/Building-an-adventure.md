The goal of preparing an adventure is to have a single sheet of paper (or short word document, scroll of parchment, stone tablet, etc.) that we can reference when running the game that will allow us to react to the actions of our players. This document should contain enough details about the story that we can sprinkle in as the players start exploring our world, interacting with the non-playable characters (NPCs), and fighting off any enemies that cross their paths.

For this exercise, we will be using the setting we created in this post - [Creating Your Adventure Setting](../_posts/2021-10-29-Creating-adventure-setting.md) to build our adventure on top of. Feel free to make your own spin on this setting or rip it out entirely for your own.

Here's a quick summary of what we have in our setting:

- The Lion's Head Mining company is looking for adventurers to help investigate strange disappearances of miners in the town of Cloverton
- The company is run by a shrewd businesswoman named Berta Clanghammer who would like to see the miners get back to work
- Rumours around town say that something evil is taking the miners, but it serves them right for venturing too close to the old dwarven territory deep within the mountains
- Cloverton's Log House tavern has a tense atmosphere with a stark divide between the miners too afraid to go back to work vs. the hunters & trappers who originally settled this town

## The Beginning

Like all great stories, we need a strong opening to really pull the players into the world and set the pace of the adventure. With the setting we have created, there's already a strong call to action that we have in place - The Lion's Head Mining company has put out a contract to local adventurers to help find the missing miners and see to it that any dangers in the mine have been dealt with.

Our job as DMs is to decide how and where we want to place the players into this adventure. We can choose to start the players out in The Log House, a tried and true start to any adventure. Or we can choose to start them out right in front of the mine to give them a direct path to the quest. We could even start the players in the middle of the forest, lost and looking for a way to the mine, becoming a mini-adventure just getting to the location of the quest. Any of these options can work and each one can be exciting in it's own way.

This is where you should ask yourself, what would be the most effective to draw **your players** into the story. It may be difficult if this is your first session or all the players at the table have never really played a tabletop roleplaying game before but over time, you will get a feel for what aspects of the game players tend to prefer. If the players like action and getting straight to the point, it might be best to lead the straight to the mine. If they prefer gathering information and preparing a little beforehand, then you might want to start them off in the town.

> I've had groups of players on both ends of this scale. One group would prefer to spend hours preparing, arming themselves with all the information possible, questioning every miner, and getting a detailed layout of the mine before they even step foot near the location. Another group would go in guns blazing, kicking down every door and always asking questions second. What's surprising is the people I had profiled to the calculated approach would do the complete opposite! Something about getting into character really brings out another side in players.

My general recommendation if you aren't sure what approach to take is to start the players as close to the quest location as possible. This will reduce the time for the players to get into the action and you can start using what you have prepared. With our beginning, we want to introduce the setting and clearly outline the goal of the quest. Give the players a few details about the world and the theme and then leave them with something to act on. Whether this is a direct action they can take or a short list of choices, give the players something to do so that the game starts.

### Adventure Start

I like to make a few bullet points that I then read over and improvise an opening to start the session off (Think: "Once upon a time, ...). You can also choose to refine the bullet points into a paragraph that you read aloud to the players before the session if you want to really iron down a script. Whichever you prefer, just keep it short to not lose the attention of your players.

- You have accepted the contract sent out by Berta Clanghammer of the Lion's Head Mining Company
- Miners have been disappearing in the mines and they are in need a group of adventurers to find them and return them safely
- A larger payout for those adventurers who go a step further and deal with the cause of the disappearances
- Lion's Head Mine is located on the outskirts of a small, rough-and-tumble town called Cloverton
- An active protest creates a blockade at the entrance of the Lion's Head Mine
- Contract states you need to make contact with the foreman, Gil, who is currently holed up in a stone building just outside the entrance

And if we wanted to refine the points further, I would read this out loud to the players when we begin:

> On the long, forested road to Cloverton, you eye over the contract once again:
>
>>"To all vagabonds, mercenaries, and rat-catchers: your skills are needed. An unknown threat seeks to ruin the Lion's Head Mining Company operations. Miners have gone missing under suspicious circumstances and we would like to see them returned so that they may resume work. Payout for the contract is 50 gold pieces a head safely returned, and a bonus of 250 gold pieces for the elimination of the threat. Speak to the foreman of the mining operation, Gil, in the office outside the entrance for more information. Signed, Berta Clanghammer"
>
>You've heard of the small settlement of Cloverton, a real rough-and tumble place that's nestled next to the Rimengul Peaks. It's hard to ignore with all the tall tales floating around about ancient dwarven treasure, dead white dragons, and deep twisting caves hidden in those mountains. You've never really thought too much about it and apparently neither have all the city-folk that are rushing to the town looking to make a quick piece.
>
>As you approach the base of one of the mountains your cart slows down and you hear a chant echoing from the entrance of the mine.
>>"Unsafe for out mates! Find them! Mine then!"
>
>A large crowd of dust-covered, working folk stand outside this ominous cave entrance. They continue chanting as your cart pulls up to a stop. You see a small stoned building with a boarded up window a few feet away from the entrance. At the door stands a rather burly-looking man banging and shouting obscenities. One of the members of the crowd breaks off from the protest and approaches your party. He looks you up and down and asks, "Have you come to join our protest?"
>
> How do you respond?

## The Middle






### Mapping out the mine


### Populating the enemies


### Treasure



## The Ending

In most narrative media we consume, it's all written by the same person or group of people and they usually have full control over all these stages. In D&D this is different. The story is not just ours alone, it also belongs to the players. So this means that when we are preparing an adventure, we can't focus on writing a concrete ending or else we end up forcing the story to go down a certain path with little input from the players.














## How much do I need to prepare?

One problem I've run into when preparing for a session is trying to account for every situation that the players might encounter during the game. Having a response for everything means I was spending a lot of extra time preparing for things that never actually happened during game. I probably used anywhere from 15% - 60% of the material I had prepped most sessions. Not to say that the things I prepared didn't help, it's more to highlight the amount of time that went into that remaining material could have been spent elsewhere. So I have adopted a minimalist approach to game preparation and always having just enough so that I use my time efficiently.

So here are the areas I would focus on for preparing this adventure:

- The start of the quest - how did the players arrive?
- What's the layout of the mine?
- What dangerous enemies might the players encounter?
- What sort of treasure can the players stumble upon?
- If the players succeed or fail, what are the consequences?
