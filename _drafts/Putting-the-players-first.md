Even as a seasoned dungeon master, I have never lost that feeling of excitement and nervousness right before running a game. I spend hours pouring over my notes and making sure I haven't missed anything. Making sure all my ideas are creative, fun, and unique. The goal being that I prepare a session that will really wow the players and leave them feeling like they walked away from a blockbuster movie starring *their characters*. From what I've learned, nothing will give your players that experience more than centering a session completely around their characters.

Don't get me wrong, there is a time and a place for a city-sprawling plot that leads to a secret vault or a mad race to find ancient artifacts hidden deep within ancient jungles. But if you want a memorable first session, one that will keep your players coming back for more, you need to put in a little work getting them involved with the story.
