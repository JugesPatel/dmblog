## Refined History

- Ages ago, a clan of dwarves discovered large mineral veins running through the mountain ranges of this region
- The enterprising dwarves tunneled deep into the mountains and pulled out riches beyond imagination
- This drew the attention of an Ancient White Dragon, Rimengul, eager to expand it's hoard and territory
- Rimengul covered the region in ice and frost, driving out the dwarves and claiming the region for itself
- Ancient heroes eventually conquered the icy beast but it's legacy lives on in name as the mountain ranges were named the Rimengul Peaks
- As the ice melted, it made way for new life to flourish thriving on the nutrient-rich soil in the region
- Trappers and hunters bravely made their way into the frigid region, making a living on the large wildlife populations
- A small settlement formed around the base of these peaks, named after the large patches of clovers found in the forests
- A prospecting company sent workers to see if the mountains contain anything of value and stumble upon deep-running mineral veins
- A mining company was quickly set-up in the region bringing a lot of newcomers into the settlement
