Even as a seasoned dungeon master, I have never lost that feeling of excitement and nervousness right before running a game. I spend hours pouring over my notes and making sure I haven't missed anything. Making sure all my ideas are creative, fun, and unique. The goal being that I prepare a session that will really *wow* the players and leave them feeling like they walked away from a blockbuster movie starring **their characters**. From what I've learned, nothing will give your players that experience more than centering a session completely around their characters.

Don't get me wrong, there is a time and a place for a city-sprawling plot that leads to a secret vault or a mad race to find ancient artifacts hidden deep within ancient jungles. But if you want a memorable first session, one that will keep your players coming back for more, you need to put in a little work getting them involved with the story. This means presenting them with a setting and getting the players to create characters that have backstories that tie into it. This doesn't require a lot of time, but this kind of thinking ahead means as you start painting out your world, they players have already bought into it. They've already invested by coming up with an adventurer that exists in your world. And this can be done even if you get the players to use pre-generated characters. You can just hand them the sheet and tell them to toss out all the backstory and come up with their own.
