In this post, we're going to take the adventure pitch from the last blog post ([Setting up Your First Game](../_posts/2021-10-07-Setting-up-your-first-game.md)) and turn it into a full blown setting with locations and a little bit of history. This is more an exercise showing you my process but feel free to change things as you see fit.

Here's a quick refresher of the pitch:

>In the small mining town of Cloverton, there spreads a great evil... Crawling, shambling closer to the light, something has been unearthed that had been buried away for a very long time. It may have been by natural forces inside the mountain or perhaps excavations by the Lion's Head Mining Company, but whatever it is needs to be dealt with. It started slowly, with a few miners going missing but now the surrounding wildlife has been scared off and the people are starting to question the dwindling supply of miners showing up to work every day. The Lion's Head Mining Company has put out a contract for helping them solve their little problem and you, brave adventurer, are the one for the job.

## A History Lesson

One thing I find that helps greatly with my improvisation during play is spending some time thinking about the history of my setting. This is also known as world-building. This may be counter intuitive since the details of the setting's history might not actually come out during play, but I find that I can improvise details that are on-theme with the setting using these as a foundation.

All we need are a few bullet points:

- A clan of dwarves were settled in the mineral-rich mountains
- An Ancient White Dragon wanted the treasures and drove the dwarves out, covering the region in ice
- Legendary heroes slayed the dragon, returning peace to the land and thawing the region
- Bands of trappers and hunters created a small settlement to hunt the fast-growing wildlife population
- Prospectors stumbled upon rich veins in the mountains and began a mining company
- The settlement grew much larger with an influx of miners looking to make a fortune

We don't need to write out too many details, just need a short timeline that tells us the story of the location. I like to build this in an iterative process where I paint broad strokes at the beginning leaving room for details to be added in later. This way, there's still an idea in your head about how this region was formed but you're not tied to specific details that you need to remember while you're running the game. As the adventurers explore the region, the history of the world can slowly be revealed.

For example, when running the game let's say one of the adventurers asks to speak to one of the elders of the town. You already have an idea of what brought that person to this isolated peninsula - a fast-growing wildlife population. You also know the conditions of the region - untamed wilderness that hadn't been touched by civilization. You could probably also make some assumptions on how they feel about the fast-growing population. All this can be improvised from the small bit of world-building you do from the beginning and as it starts coming out in game, you can feel free to add details to this history and make it a reality for your setting.

## Important Locations

Now that we have the history, let's start adding some substance to the setting. We only need to describe a few important locations that the adventurers are most likely to go to since the majority of the adventure is going to focus on the mine. If the characters decide to venture out and do a little exploring beforehand, we have some options prepared for where they may go. And for anywhere else not prepared, feel free to use this same process to improvise something on the fly.

Again, keep these descriptions short and punchy. Try to come up with a few bullet points to capture the theme of the location and maybe include something interesting that the adventurers may interact with. This is where you could also add some non-playable characters (NPCs) into the world that the adventurers can encounter.

Here's a few locations that might exist in the area that the adventurers might encounter:

### Lion's Head Mine

- An ominous cave entrance that opens wide with a jagged row of stalagmites and stalagtites lining the entrance
- Cart tracks run from inside the mine to a stone building just outside the entrance
- Miners are seen going in and out of the cave with the rhythmic sound of steel hitting stone echoes through the shaft
- The mine is overseen by an cowardly foreman named Viktor

> With all our descriptions, we want to evoke a strong mental image that the players can instantly picture. We want to start with a strong focal point and fill in details. Use these bullet points as a jumping off point and as the adventurers explore, start improvising more details.

#### Viktor the Foreman

- 

> For improvising the NPCs like Viktor, the easiest way to portray them is by picking a character from a book or movie and just trying your best to recreate them in this world. Just have fun with it and try to act out some mannerisms and quirks that this character may have. This is definitely a skill that improves over time and there are countless videos on the internet for helping develop this. One thing to keep handy for these NPCs is a bulleted list of key information that would be useful for the adventurers.

### The Log House Tavern

- A spacious log cabin where the workers of the settlement go to revel and drink the night away
- The tavern is run by a large gruff man named Houghton who used to be a logger before erecting this tavern
- There is a stark divide down the center of the tavern as if marked by a line. Hunters and trappers sit on one side, miners sit on the other.
- A large round table sits in the center of the Log House carved with all sorts of illustrations and placed upon it is a small brass coffer.
- **The Table of Tales** - A long standing tradition in the Log House, anyone is allowed to toss a few pieces into the coffer and stand up on the table to recount a fantastic experience or tell a tall tale. The stories that get harmonious approval from the patrons and the barkeep are then carved into the table itself by Houghton.

> Notice how this description is a little more thought out, even including an activity for the adventurers to partake in. Taverns are a great place for adventurers to find information and meet with the locals and they are also likely to spend a few nights here so it's worth the effort of prepping a little more. Including the part about how hunters and trappers separate themselves from the miners can give the players a great idea of the atmosphere of the town.

### Lion's Head Mining Company Headquarters

- Run by a shrewd dwarf named Barok Clanghammer
- A large two-story stone building located at the edge of town nearest the mine
- Protests led by miners complaining about the unsafe conditions are a common sight outside the building
- The headquarters stockpile extra mining equipment and frequently exports wagon loads of ore

> Here we want to show that the world is reacting to the events of the story and not just the adventurers. This is a great location for the adventurers to find out more information about the contract to better prepare themselves for the mine.

### Hunters and Trapper's Guild

- A winding, forested road leads to the top of a hill where this imposing cabin sits
- A place for hunters and trappers of this region to gather and resupply, occasionally share information
- Large mounted skulls and taxidermied heads of beasts stare as you walk through the cabin

> Now we start adding locations that the adventures could stumble upon but are also likely to just skip over. The majority of the settlement will have locations like this where they may not be super relevant to the story at hand but could come up if the adventurers decide to seek them out. For locations like these, I like to improvise most of the details during game and I could prepare as little as the name of the location and maybe an NPC that can be found.

## Roughly Mapping the Area









## Getting the Players Involved with Prep

If you have some time before the scheduled session, ask your players some of these questions so we can tailor the adventure around something they might be interested in:

- How did your character hear about this contract?
- Is your character taking this job to make money or for altruistic reasons?
- Does your character have any family in the town of Cloverton, or the surrounding area?

We can spur the players' imagination with these sorts of questions and once they start answering, write everything down. We can go over our notes we've written for the setting and change or rewrite parts to fit the adventurers in. By integrating the backstories of your characters into the setting, it will further enhance the experience and actually give the players a chance to contribute more to the story.

You can ask your players these questions through a simple text thread or it could be a conversation. Once they start answering these questions, you might get asked questions about the setting in return and if you haven't come up with the exact details, just start making it up! Or better yet, ask the players what they might like to see and start incorporating it into our notes.
