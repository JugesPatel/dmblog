The great thing about jumping into 5th edition of D&D is that there are free resources out there for you and a group of friends to start playing. All the basic rules are available for you online to download and reference.

## Game Rules

Now the biggest question of your DM-ing career is figuring out if you are old-school and like having notes written down in front of you or whether you prefer the convenience of technology and features it provides. The publishers of D&D, Wizards of the Coast, have made the basic rules of the game available for everyone to use.

If you want all the rules offline, at your fingertips, this is the best place to get them: [Basic rules in a PDF](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)`

If you prefer an interactive online tool-set, use this site: [Basic rules on DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules)

Either way, these rules are more than enough for yourself and your players to actually play a game of D&D.
